# Surfs_up Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to run some analytics on a weather data set before investing in Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists in Hawaii.

## Resources:
* Software: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, VSB

## Results:
The Summary Statistics results for December show that the low (minimum) temperature is 56 degrees, the high (maximum) temperature is 83 degrees, and the average temperature is approximately 71.04 degrees. When we compare this result with June, the min, max and average  temp is 64 degrees, 85 degrees and 74.9 degrees, respectively.

As it can be seen on the graphs below, the majority of temperature reading for the month of June were above 75 degrees.

On the other hand, in the month  Decemeber most of the data points/temperature reading  concentrated in between 75 and 65 degrees. 

From the result shown above, there is no significant change in temprature comparing the two month data in which we can take them as a representative sampling for the summer and winter weather. And hence, I recommend investing in Surf and Shake shop in Hawaii will be a profitabile and a strong business plan.
